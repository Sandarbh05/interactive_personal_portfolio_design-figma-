Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹,
In this repository I have added fully interactive figma based local static copy of my personal portfolio.
Designs has been created entirely by me.
Took an entire week to finish.
Must import and save to your drafts in figma, then click the play icon at the top right corner right next to blue share button---> It will open the file in prototype mode, here you can play with the pages. I have set easter eggs to it as well.
It may get updated in the future, but if you like this version you can save and replace images and details according to your needs.
